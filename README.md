# Impulse Business Competition
BOOST Marketing aims to connect skilled students to organizations who want to market to them. Ran by three dedicated entrepreneurs, BOOST recognizes the gap between companies who may not know how to market to youth, and gives students the opportunity to put their design skills to use and expand their portfolios to new horizons. In addition, with the exponential rate of climate change, the marketing tools used will be less resource-intensive, and takes advantage of the ever-growing number of youth using technology on a day-to-day basis.
