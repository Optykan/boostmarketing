# Impulse Business Competition
BOOST Marketing aims to connect skilled students to organizations who want to market to them. Run by three dedicated entrepreneurs, BOOST recognizes the gap between companies who may not know how to market to youth, and gives students the opportunity to put their design skills to use and expand their portfolios to new horizons. BOOST encourages the use of online tools in order to lower environmental impact.
